Title: The Eerie Journey of Dolores Martinez Briones

Script: Dolores Martinez Briones, a 15-year-old girl living on a secluded military base with her parents, found herself awakened by the oppressive heat in the dead of night. Struggling to find solace in the sweltering air, she decided to open the windows and gaze at the starry canvas above. Amidst the stillness, an indescribable urge compelled her to glance towards a nearby field.

At first, her eyes fell upon nothing but the moon's radiant glow. However, as her gaze sharpened, a sight both otherworldly and terrifying materialized before her. A dull metallic cylinder-shaped craft hovered approximately 200 meters away, defying the boundaries of earthly possibility.

The silence shattered when, minutes later, a hatch on the craft's lower section opened. Two men, seemingly oblivious to Dolores' presence, descended from the hatch on a metallic platform, wearing white outfits akin to those of doctors. It wasn't until they detected Dolores' presence that their attention fixated upon her, staring intently. Paralyzed with fear, she watched from behind the safety of her window while the men ominously approached.

Suddenly, a clear message resounded within her mind, assuring her of their peaceful intent and urging her to relax. Overwhelmed with a newfound tranquility, Dolores hesitantly opened the door, relinquishing her grip on her fear. Stepping outside, she cautiously followed the men towards their enigmatic craft, enticed by an unspoken invitation that transcended human communication.

Up close, Dolores observed that the two men resembled humans, towering at 1.80 meters with fair skin, brown hair, and brown eyes. Their distinct white uniforms and thick-soled, ghostly-white shoes added an eerie aura to their ethereal presence. As if awash in deference, Dolores ventured closer and found herself faced with a third figure. This elder entity exuded a wisdom borne of countless years, with his white hair and short beard emphasizing his advanced age. He wore a flowing white tunic and, like the others, donned the distinctive white shoes.

Greeting Dolores with a warm gesture, the elder alien beckoned her into the heart of the craft. Stepping inside, she was greeted by an otherworldly sight — the ceiling, walls, and halls adorned with kaleidoscopic lights. In the center, a metallic desk and bench seemed to meld seamlessly with the craft itself. Drawing closer, the elder alien asked Dolores if she desired to learn about his enigmatic planet and pledged her eventual return. Curiosity lured her in, and she eagerly agreed, donning a thin, almost transparent white suit provided by the elder alien.

With preparations complete, she was instructed to hold onto a ledge for the duration of the journey. As the craft resumed its eerie silence, the elder alien pressed buttons on a control panel reminiscent of a microwave, orchestrating their voyage through the cosmos. Minutes passed in immeasurable silence, until the elder alien informed Dolores that they had traversed outer space, spanning a distance beyond mortal comprehension. Their celestial destination, theoretically situated approximately 2 light years away, remained unremembered to Dolores, lost amongst fleeting cosmic knowledge.

Throughout the journey, Dolores marveled at the absence of motion, an absence that defied logic and reality. Yet, an insatiable desire to behold the stars compelled her to approach the elder alien, requesting a view beyond the veiled dimensions of the craft. In response, the alien activated a small window-like opening, revealing an impenetrable void devoid of starlight. The elder alien explained the consequences of their immense velocity, leaving Dolores yearning for a connection to the cosmic tapestry.

Seizing a rare moment of vulnerability, she inquired about the elder alien's name. In response, he implored her to refer to him as the "Elder One," revealing the limitations imposed by their codes. Dolores noticed that only the elder alien communicated verbally, while the other two employed telepathy, unlocking the alien realm to her yet again.

Time transcended on their astral odyssey until the elder alien proposed a glimpse of their distant planet. Intrigued, Dolores accepted, prompting the alien to reveal a window that unveiled an infinitesimal orb of brilliance — the alien's homeworld. Like a solitary jewel adrift in eternity, it captivated Dolores with its transcendental beauty. The craft descended, and like a clandestine secret, a door unveiled an enclosed area, where they underwent a purifying sterilization process.

When the door finally opened, Dolores stepped forth, embraced by a foreign ambiance. In this bewildering space, a luminous corridor bore witness to countless individuals perpetually engrossed in their duties. Their shared attire of beige-blue clothing, coupled with their uniform short hair and slender frames, rendered them indistinguishable from one another – a sea of anonymous denizens. Curiously, Dolores noted the conspicuous absence of elderly individuals, except for her constant companion, the leader. An enigmatic reverence encompassed his presence, permeating every gesture and decision he imparted.

Led deeper into this enigmatic world, they navigated mazes of corridors, each orchestrated with meticulous precision. Merely hummed conversations filled the air, devoid of laughter or levity. Eventually, they arrived at living quarters, measuring a mere six by six meters, each designed for six individuals. Positioned before a small window, Dolores glimpsed bonbon-shaped pieces with an otherworldly hue. Intriguing as they were, she declined this peculiar offering.

Further exploration unravelled an expansive auditorium, revealing their shared belief in a universal God. Upon this revelation, Dolores found herself transported to a domain exclusively entrusted to children. Amidst computer consoles, an adult woman oversaw peculiar hieroglyphic symbols, among which Dolores recognized the letters Z and X. As if an ethereal tether, the dynamics of this realm invited Dolores with the innocence of an 8-year-old child, casting a brief but genuine smile of welcome.

The journey continued, leading Dolores to a hidden oasis enveloped within a transparent dome, a resplendent spectacle teeming with exotic flora. The elder alien explained that these earthly blooms were remnants from their home planet, ravaged by the cruel depletion of its ozone layer. Gazing upon the vibrant life beneath the dome, he revealed they survived solely on the scarce water reserved for sustenance, a testament to their tenacious survival against the ravages of an unforgiving universe.

Time withered away, extending a hand towards departure as Dolores traversed familiar corridors. In their final moments together, the elder alien posed a question, his piercing gaze locking with Dolores' eyes. Temptation lingered in the air like a palpable current, offering Dolores the chance to join them permanently. Overwhelmed by conflicts of heart and home, she mustered her resolve and declined the seductive allure of an interstellar destiny.

Once more enveloped in the traveling suit, Dolores found herself escorted back onboard the craft by the two silent sentinels of the unknown. The indifferent populace bade her no farewell, lost in a rhythm of indifference. The return journey commenced, a symphony of silence. Upon her return, the elder alien's final words echoed in her mind, an injunction veiled in secrecy – her astounding encounter relegated to the realms of disbelief.

Arriving at her front door, Dolores paused, hoping for a lingering sight of the craft and its ethereal occupants. Alas, they had vanished into the ether, leaving Dolores with naught but a haunting sense of unfulfilled potential. To this day, she remains haunted by the choices, questioning her decision to decline the alien's invitation once the true nature of her encounter became unverifiable.

TLDR: In the dead of night, 15-year-old Dolores Martinez Briones witnesses a metallic craft and is invited to travel to an alien planet by three human-like aliens. Through her journey, she encounters a society of almost identical beings with advanced technology, peculiar living arrangements, and a shared faith in a universally recognizable higher power. However, despite the allure, Dolores ultimately declines the invitation and returns home, forever marked by the unknowable potential of an interstellar existence.

Back onboard the craft, Dolores was escorted by the silent sentinels of the unknown as they returned her home. The indifferent populace bade her farewell, lost in their rhythm of indifference.
