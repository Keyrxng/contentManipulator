Title: The Haunting of Apartment 13

I want to start off by saying that I am usually very skeptical when it comes to unexplainable things. At least I try to be, and it has served me well to keep my cool in otherwise scary situations. However, for the life of me, I still cannot find an explanation for what I saw that day. And I’d like to emphasize that this story is 100% real.

Like every good story, I’m gonna start with some context. It was back in 2012 when I, a 14-year-old boy named Michael, had just moved to America the year prior without my parents. I was staying with my uncle, who was only a few years older than me and thought of as the "cool uncle." We had the same sense of humor and similar interests. This became important when my uncle, who was seeing this girl named Ann, wanted to spend the weekend at her apartment. Reluctantly, he asked me to go with him, and I agreed, knowing it would be a boring weekend.

Fortunately, I managed to borrow a friend's PS3, but Ann's apartment didn't have Wi-Fi, posing a challenge for entertainment. Nevertheless, I set up the console and started playing, intending to stay on it the whole time. As the night progressed, my uncle and Ann went upstairs, leaving me engrossed in my game.

However, strange noises downstairs began to disrupt my concentration. At first, I dismissed them as Ann's sister and her boyfriend, assuming they had returned from somewhere. Ignoring the commotion, I continued playing until I realized I had left the borrowed PS3 downstairs. Concerned that something might happen to it, I decided to retrieve it.

As I made my way downstairs, the darkness struck me as odd. It was late, so I expected the lights to be on if people were still awake. Entering the kitchen, I was confronted with a surreal sight - every object on the countertops and stovetop was moving in a bizarre, seesaw-like motion. Pots, pans, utensils, and even bottles were bouncing up and down as if possessed. The eerie noise reverberated throughout the house, shaking me to my core.

Initially, I was too stunned to react. In hindsight, I must have been in shock. After grabbing the PS3, I retraced my steps back upstairs, trying to ignore the fear creeping in. It wasn't until I reached the safety of the room that I realized the gravity of what I had witnessed, sending me into a fit of hyperventilation. Eventually, exhaustion overcame me, and I drifted off to sleep.

Upon waking the next morning, I couldn't shake off the lingering unease. Reluctantly, I shared my haunting experience with my uncle. At first, he laughed it off, disbelieving. However, when he relayed the story to Ann, her expression turned grave. She revealed that similar occurrences had happened to her and her sister, hearing voices and a disembodied voice calling her name. Moreover, she informed us about a tragic incident where a child had died after falling down the stairs in that very apartment complex.

To this day, I remain perplexed about what truly happened. Although many might attempt to rationalize the events, I firmly believe there is no logical explanation for the supernatural encounter I had that night. Needless to say, I never stepped foot in that apartment again.
