# Monologue
On a frosty winter evening in 1970, I find myself transported to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, where a bone-chilling tale unfolded. Picture this - a group of scouts, led by their fearless Scoutmaster Eugene Smith, embarked on a treacherous journey along the Appalachian Trail. Little did they know that something sinister awaited them amidst the snow-capped mountains.

Our protagonist, sixteen-year-old scout Geoffrey Hague, brimming with youthful restlessness, made a fateful decision. As they reached the junction of the Appalachian Trail and the Boulevard Trail, Geoffrey announced that he needed to take a moment to rest, oblivious to the horrors that awaited him.

With a flurry of snowflakes dancing in the biting cold, his companions continued their journey, leaving Geoffrey behind. And it is in this moment, in the icy embrace of the Great Smoky Mountains, that Geoffrey's fate was sealed.

The authorities launched a frantic search, enlisting the help of hundreds of volunteers, including the legendary Green Berets and their trusted canine companions. Yet, the clues they stumbled upon only deepened the mystery.

Amongst the frozen expanse, a bone-chilling sight awaited them - Geoffrey's belongings, balancing precariously on a rock in the middle of an icy stream. It sent shivers down their spines. How did his belongings find their eerie resting spot? And who, in the name of all that is unholy, could have orchestrated such a macabre act?

Eventually, Geoffrey's lifeless body was found, not far from that haunting rock, approximately two-fifths of a mile away. His dreams and ambitions swallowed by the ruthless cold, forever trapped in the frigid wilderness.

Whispers began to creep through the mist-laden forest, weaving tales of a sinister force that lured Geoffrey astray. Some believed it was an otherworldly enticement, a siren's call that led him to his demise. Others pointed fingers at the spirits that whispered through the mountains, seeking unwary souls to join their ghostly gatherings.

But in the midst of these eerie speculations, one thing became abundantly clear - Geoffrey's disappearance was no ordinary accident or twist of fate. No, my friends, there was something malevolent in the air, an unseen presence lurking in the shadowy depths of the Great Smoky Mountains, waiting for its next victim.

And so, the tale of Geoffrey Hague serves as a chilling reminder of the mysteries that lie concealed in the heart of nature. As we venture into those hallowed grounds, our breath hitching with every creak and rustle, we must ask ourselves - who, or what, lurks beneath the veil of the Great Smoky Mountains? What unspeakable horrors await those who dare to tread upon these hallowed lands?

Reader beware, for the Great Smoky Mountains hold secrets that defy understanding. Sometimes, it's best to let sleeping horrors lie in the icy depths of the unknown. Shall we proceed into the darkness or shall we heed the cautionary whispers that echo through the trees? The choice, my friends, is yours to make.
