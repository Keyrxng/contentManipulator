Title: The Unwanted Companion

Our story takes place in a quaint hotel nestled within a serene state park. The atmosphere is serene, as the protagonist, a young and ambitious hotel employee, finds herself alone in the building after hours. Little did she know that this seemingly peaceful evening would soon turn into a bone-chilling nightmare.

As the protagonist settles into the office, nursing a sore chest and a less-than-ideal mood, an unexpected visitor walks through the lobby doors. The man bears a striking resemblance to a certain actor who once portrayed Spiderman. For simplicity, we'll refer to him as "Spiderman" throughout the story.

Spiderman politely asks for permission to use the restroom and charge his phone, coming across as innocuous. Engaging her in conversation, Spiderman rambles on about his profession as a life coach and his admiration for customer service. However, the young hotel employee's chest pain prevents her from indulging in small talk, and she responds mainly with forced politeness.

Feeling a sense of obligation, the employee inadvertently hints at her evening work hours when describing her availability for future encounters. Oblivious to the inadvertent invitation, Spiderman takes note of the vague schedule, planting a seed in his mind for future encounters.

Days pass, and the hotel is bustling with activity. Weddings and events fill the atmosphere, leaving the employee swamped with responsibilities. Amidst the chaos, Spiderman reappears unexpectedly, eagerly seeking engagement yet again. Unaware that he is a guest, his return catches the employee off guard. Trying to maintain professionalism, the employee's demeanor turns cold and distant, prioritizing the pressing matters at hand.

Spiderman, sensitive to the change in disposition, questions the sudden coldness. An outburst from the employee reflects her pent-up frustration, finally expressing her discomfort and the need to focus on her demanding workload. Spiderman, taken aback, suggests that she takes a break and assures her that he can wait. Though appreciative of the consideration, the employee dismisses his offer, remaining focused on her duties.

The employee's distress escalates when Spiderman's presence becomes a recurring theme. He loiters around the lobby, treating conversations with fellow employees as opportunities to mention their previous encounters and inflate his self-importance. The employee realizes that Spiderman's fascination for her is far from harmless and begins to feel a growing sense of unease.

Venting her concerns to her colleagues, the employee discovers that Spiderman's peculiarities extend beyond their interactions. The revelation surfaces that he had been causing unrest in another hotel, even mailing his books as a bizarre gesture. As the unsettling truth unravels, the employee becomes keenly aware of her vulnerability.

Determined to distance herself from this unwelcome companion, the employee musters the courage to address the issue head-on. Confronting Spiderman, she asserts her discomfort and explains the need to establish boundaries. Through a tense exchange, she makes it abundantly clear that his presence only fuels her unease.

Spiderman, refusing to acknowledge any inappropriate behavior, challenges the employee's perception, denying any form of romantic interest. Emotions escalate, and a heated argument ensues, revealing the employee's mounting frustration with her inability to be candid during their previous interactions due to professional constraints.

Soon after, the employee learns that Spiderman's unsettling tendencies had led to his banishment from another hotel. The revelation affirms her instincts and reinforces the importance of her warning signs. Relieved by the banishment, she continues her work at the hotel but remains cautious of potential encounters.

Ultimately, the employee triumphs as a victor in her battle against the unwanted companion. Her story serves as a sobering reminder to always trust one's instincts and assert boundaries, even in the face of professional constraints.

# Monologue
[Start of monologue]

Once upon a time, in a peaceful state park, there stood a charming little hotel. It was a place of tranquility and serenity, where guests came to escape the hustle and bustle of everyday life. But this story isn't about the guests; it's about one particular employee, a young and ambitious protagonist, who found herself alone in the hotel after hours. Little did she know that this seemingly peaceful evening would soon turn into a bone-chilling nightmare.

As she settled into the office, nursing a sore chest and a less-than-ideal mood, an unexpected visitor walked through the lobby doors. And let me tell you, this visitor was no ordinary person. He bore a striking resemblance to a certain actor who once donned the red and blue suit of Spiderman. Now, just for simplicity's sake, we'll refer to him as "Spiderman" throughout the story.

Spiderman, clad in a suit and tie, politely asked for permission to use the restroom and charge his phone. Innocuous enough, right? Engaging her in conversation, Spiderman rambled on about his profession as a life coach, and his admiration for customer service. However, the young hotel employee's chest pain prevented her from indulging in small talk. She responded mainly with forced politeness.

Feeling a sense of obligation, the employee inadvertently hinted at her evening work hours when describing her availability for future encounters. Oblivious to the inadvertent invitation, Spiderman took note of the vague schedule and planted a seed in his mind for future encounters.

Days passed, and the hotel became a bustling hive of activity. Weddings, conferences, and events filled the atmosphere, leaving the employee swamped with responsibilities. Amidst the chaos, Spiderman reappeared unexpectedly, eagerly seeking engagement yet again. Unaware that he was actually a guest, his return caught the employee off guard. Trying to maintain professionalism, her demeanor turned cold and distant, as she prioritized the pressing matters at hand.

Spiderman, sensitive to the change in disposition, questioned the sudden coldness. An outburst from the employee reflected her pent-up frustration, as she finally expressed her discomfort and the need to focus on her demanding workload. Spiderman, taken aback, suggested that she take a break and assured her that he could wait. Though appreciative of the consideration, the employee dismissed his offer, remaining focused on her duties.

But the employee's distress escalated when Spiderman's presence became a recurring theme. He loitered around the lobby, treating conversations with fellow employees as opportunities to mention their previous encounters and inflate his self-importance. It soon became clear to the employee that Spiderman's fascination for her was far from harmless. She began to feel a growing sense of unease.

Venting her concerns to her colleagues, the employee discovered that Spiderman's peculiarities extended beyond their interactions. The unsettling truth surfaced that he had been causing unrest in another hotel, even mailing his books as a bizarre gesture. As the unsettling truth unraveled, the employee became keenly aware of her vulnerability.

Determined to distance herself from this unwanted companion, the employee mustered the courage to address the issue head-on. She confronted Spiderman, asserting her discomfort, and explaining the need to establish boundaries. Through a tense exchange, she made it abundantly clear that his presence only fueled her unease.

Ultimately, the employee triumphed as a victor in her battle against the unwanted companion. Her story serves as a sobering reminder to always trust one's instincts and assert boundaries, even in the face of professional constraints.

So, dear listeners, remember to stay vigilant, trust your instincts, and never be afraid to assert your boundaries. Who knows, you might just save yourself from an unwanted companion like Spiderman.
