I Am An Uber Driver My Last Client Wasn't Normal

I had always heard stories about demons and angels growing up, but I never thought I would encounter one myself. As an Uber driver, I picked up countless passengers in the dead of night, but my encounter with Kyle was different. Little did I know, it would change the course of my life forever.

It was a typical Friday night when Kyle got into my car. Dressed sharply and exuding an aura of mystery, he immediately caught my attention. Something about him was off, but I couldn't quite put my finger on it. As we embarked on the journey to his destination, I engaged in small talk, trying to break the ice.

The conversation took a dark turn when Kyle mentioned my past transgression with infidelity. Shocked, I denied it, but he was relentless, revealing details only a few could have known. Panic swept over me as I realized he was no ordinary passenger.

As we continued our conversation, Kyle revealed himself to be a demon, seeking my sins as his prize. He offered me a deal – to commit sins in his name and be rewarded accordingly. Overwhelmed and fearing for my family's safety, I reluctantly accepted. Kyle handed me his card, instructing me to recite his name when committing the sins.

The following year was a downward spiral. I accidentally killed a man in a car accident and became consumed by alcoholism. My marriage teetered on the brink of collapse, and in a moment of weakness, I sought solace with a prostitute. The sins piled up, staining my soul further with each passing day, all the while counting the minutes until Kyle's return.

When the dreaded day arrived, Kyle appeared, jubilant at the harvest of sins I had reaped. He praised their magnitude, promising me rewards for my contributions. Wracked with guilt and fear, I couldn't fathom what he had in store for me.

As Kyle approached, his eyes transformed into impenetrable voids, inducing a surge of terror. Trembling, I begged for mercy, expressing my desire for money, safety, and health. Desperate to escape his clutches, I closed my eyes, awaiting my fate.

When I awoke, I found myself in my bed with my wife beside me, unaware of the sins I had committed. True to his word, Kyle had erased the memories of those sins, leaving no trace of their existence. Miraculously, my life had taken a turn for the better. A large sum of money filled my bank account, and my body transformed into that of a healthy, fit individual.

Each year, Kyle returned, repeating the cycle of sin and reward. I tread carefully, terrified of disappointing him and the consequences that would follow. Yet, as the years passed by, I lost more than just my sins. The rewards came at a great cost – my emotions, my sense of right and wrong, and the ability to make mistakes.

Life became meaningless as I watched my loved ones age and pass away while I remained eternally trapped in the cycle. No longer desiring youth, I longed for death, but even that seemed out of reach. The demon had taken everything from me, leaving me as a mere shell of my former self.

I share this cautionary tale not as a means of redemption, but as a warning. Deals with demons come at an immeasurable cost. They take not only what you willingly give, but also the intangible aspects of your existence. I am but a servant to the demon, forever bound by an eternal bargain. Beware the allure of sinister promises, for they lead only to desolation and an endless cycle of regret.
