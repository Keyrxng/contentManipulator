Title: Bound by Shadows - The Enigma of Susan Nettleton's Tragic End

Script: The dilapidated driveway leading to the house still haunts my memories. It resembled a treacherous dirt mountain, aptly named "62 All Wheel Drive." During my childhood, whenever my parents were away, I sought solace with my cousin and aunt in this secluded corner of Windsor, New Hampshire. My dear Aunt Susan was a beacon of warmth and comfort. She would whip up delicious snacks and let me indulge in WWE matches, shielding me from the torments of the older kids. As I grew into an outcast teenager, her small gas station, reminiscent of a bodega, became my sanctuary. I would escape there for phone calls, a sandwich, a respite, or simply to talk to Sue. And I wasn't the only one - Sue had become a surrogate mother to many children in our close-knit town.

But everything changed in the blink of an eye.

**December 30th, 2015**

In the hidden recesses of Windsor, New Hampshire, an enigmatic and tragic incident unfurled. Susan Nettleton, my beloved aunt, a pillar of the community, met an untimely and harrowing demise at the age of 39.

Ever since her shocking passing, the void left behind by Susan's absence has weighed heavily on me, compelling me to seek answers.

**Background:**

Susan Nettleton wasn't just an ordinary resident of Windsor; she was an extraordinary woman who touched countless lives. For eighteen long years, she dedicated herself tirelessly to a local gas station in Hillsboro, Najibs, until she took over and rechristened it as "Sue's Superette." This metamorphosis wasn't merely a change in name; it symbolized Susan's newfound autonomy and unwavering commitment to serving her community.

Yet, Susan's story had depths far beyond the triumph of her entrepreneurial success. As her niece, I bore witness to her struggles. Susan had endured years of abuse in her marriage to Douglas, her husband. Trapped in a situation she desperately sought escape from, Susan resolutely shielded her son, Jeremy, from his father's wrath. She had married Douglas at a tender age of 17, when she unexpectedly fell pregnant, and the ensuing pressures of society's norms and financial constraints ensnarled her in a web of turmoil.

But when she assumed ownership of the gas station, Susan's life took an unexpected turn. The previous owner, acknowledging her unwavering loyalty and dedication, generously handed over the reins at a nominal price. It marked the beginning of a new chapter in Susan's life, one brimming with hope, independence, and the promise of a brighter tomorrow.

As her niece, I intimately witnessed Susan's agony and despair. She concealed her troubles poorly, confiding in my mother about her ongoing battle with depression. The weight of her emotions manifested in physical form as she gained weight due to the unrelenting stress. She often voiced her fears regarding her husband, her apprehension palpable. Yet, despite her arduous journey, she clung to the belief that happiness would find its way back to her.

In the days leading up to her death, the conversations I had with her were imbued with newfound excitement. She eagerly embraced the bright future that lay before her. Her grandson had just been born, and she beamed with pride. Her son had transformed from a troubled adult to a dedicated family man, about to embark on the journey of marriage. Moreover, Susan herself stood on the precipice of gaining the independence she had yearned for.

Something extraordinary transpired during that time. Susan's liberation seemed to breathe life back into her weary soul. Those closest to her, including myself, reminisce about how her smile returned, her happiness resurfaced, and her spirit rekindled. She rebuilt bridges with old friends, relished her role as a business owner and grandmother, and rediscovered the joy that had long eluded her.

Yet, as her happiness swelled, tragedy struck. While the world prepared for New Year's Eve festivities, Susan shattered the news to Douglas that she was leaving him.

**The Unsolved Mystery:**

On that ill-fated night in December 2015, I doubtlessly recall the charred remnants of a car that held my aunt's lifeless body. Jeremy, Susan's son, was jolted by the cacophony of the engine as he entered his childhood home to discuss New Year's Eve plans. In a heartbreaking testimony to our family, he described the devastation he encounteredâ€”an image etched indelibly into our minds. "In the fiery garage, I found her," he said. "Chained to a chair, her silent pleas echoing in my ears, a lit cigarette between her trembling fingers." He struggled to free her, but the car proved impervious to his desperate efforts. Consumed by heat and flames, he contacted 911 and his father, compelled by a desperate impetus to save her. But by the time first responders arrived, it was too late. Susan was gone.

Douglas repeatedly alluded to an insurance policy he had recently taken out on Susan, insinuating financial motivations in her demise. Although he received a meager payout that aided in repairing the garage and yielded a modest lump sum, questions loom over whether he received more than what he let on.

As her niece, I have been plagued by Susan's death, haunted by a trail of unanswered questions. The investigation into her demise proved daunting, her charred remains presenting obstacles to unlocking the truth. Douglas claimed that the identification process was painstaking due to a lack of tangible evidence, insisting "there was nothing left, she was gone, reduced to dust." However, my family pressed for more action, unyielding in our quest for answers. Why were there so few responders? Why was she chained? Why did everything seem shrouded in vagueness? Jeremy and Douglas continuously mentioned obtaining a lawyer, but none ever materialized. My sister and cousin offered financial assistance, yet my uncle fervently dismissed their gesture, invoking a desire for privacy amidst the overwhelming support of our community. Susan's gas station became a sea of flowers and plush toys, a somber memorial that stood for months.

During that week following her funeral, my widely scattered family united, and untold dark secrets emerged, further shrouding our grief.

Furthermore, it recently came to my attention that Susan had been estranged from her birth family, and they only learned of her passing more recently. It feels as though justice has been snatched away from her, and we must embark on a quest to uncover the truth.

I adamantly refuse to accept the sequence of events presented to us. I struggle to comprehend how this woman, finally unburdened and brimming with newfound life, could "chain" herself to a car, let alone orchestrate an explosive end.

**Seeking Answers and Closure:**

To this day, my family and I are haunted by restlessness and uncertainty. We grapple with grief, forced into a ceaseless battle for solace. It is imperative that we find answers to the myriad of questions that torment us, to attain closure for ourselves and honor Susan's memory. But where do we begin? What questions shall we pose? How can we unravel this intricate web of deception?

Restless unease pervades many others as well. Our family's social media profiles have fallen prey to manipulation and harassment, with disturbing bios and messages bearing sinister intent. Recently, even the memorial page created for Susan has thrust our family into turmoil. It reached out to us with chilling messages before abruptly severing ties with some family members, its bio now eerily reading, "My husband murdered me and got away with it!!!"

It is with heavy hearts that we discovered how disconnected Susan had become from her biological family, and how they only recently discovered her untimely demise. Justice has been denied, and we must strive to investigate these labyrinthine circumstances.

I harbor a profound disbelief in the official account of events, fueled by the belief that something is being actively concealed. If my intuition proves misguided, and the truth aligns with the official narrative, I can only succumb to sorrow. However, we refuse to disbelieve that this woman, who had freed herself from the shackles of her past, would "chain" herself to a car, let alone engineer her own demise.

**Conclusion:**

The unresolved enigma of Susan Nettleton's death in Windsor, New Hampshire, beseeches further inquiry. It is a story that haunts our community and our family, leaving us embroiled in a perpetual quest for answers. Susan's transformation from a gas station employee to an indomitable business owner, her relentless pursuit of happiness in the face of adversity, paints a hauntingly complex picture. The search for truth marches on, and we fervently hope that one day, the shadows will retreat, unraveling the secrets that shroud her tragic end. My heart aches for her absence. Tattooed tributes bearing her name adorn the bodies of those who loved her, while an entire town buzzes with whispers of something amiss. I remember her fondly, a beautiful soul who bestowed upon me my first drink. She valiantly protected me from her husband's darkness, enduring unspeakable horrors of her own. We shall not forget how, even in death, Susan managed to unite our fragmented family, with her last batch of pizza dough serving as both the catalyst for mustard pizza and cherished memories. Bound by a love that defied blood ties, she was the glue that held us together.

\[Author's Note: This post, penned by Susan Nettleton's niece, aims to raise questions and shed light on the perplexing circumstances surrounding Susan's death, inviting respectful discussion and awareness within the r/unresolvedmysteries community. We welcome any new insights or information and encourage responsible exploration into this case. Please feel free to voice your queries.\]
