Title: The Drawn Prophecies

Once there was a man named Bob Oster, a troubled father whose daughter, Katie, possessed a unique ability. She drew chilling prophecies that seemed to come true. Detective River Hawthorne of the Toronto Police Service interviewed Bob about the disturbing events surrounding Katie's drawings and his daughter's disappearance.

Bob recounted the first drawing Katie made—a coyote devouring a dead cat. It seemed innocent at the time, but shortly after, their neighbor's cat was mauled by a coyote. The second drawing depicted two children drowning in a river, foretelling the tragic fate of the Pezzola brothers, who drowned in an undertow. These bizarre coincidences alarmed Bob and made him question the nature of his daughter's drawings.

Katie insisted that she didn't remember drawing these prophecies and claimed a "head voice" whispered the information to her. Bob, terrified by his daughter's uncanny predictions, confided in his father, who dismissed it as nonsense.

After a year of respite, Katie's drawings resumed. Bob, hoping to prevent the death vision of his father choking on steak, took desperate measures to intervene. He witnessed Katie drawing his deceased father, his face purple and eyes bulging. Bob's fears heightened when his father indeed choked to death on steak exactly as depicted in the drawing.

Overwhelmed with fear, Bob distanced himself from Katie, unable to face the terrifying truth she seemed to possess. Yet, his curiosity got the better of him, and he decided to check on Katie one day while she was in a trance, drawing at her desk. To his horror, she was drawing his own death—an image of him crushed inside a car.

Panicking, Bob tried to force Katie to change the drawing, but she refused, claiming it couldn't be altered. In a moment of frenzy, Bob struck Katie, unintentionally injuring her. Consumed by guilt and desperation, he disposed of the drawing and called the police, reporting Katie missing.

However, astonishingly, Katie was found alive days later. Detective Hawthorne informed Bob of Katie's survival, hoping this would bring him some solace. But Bob was inconsolable, overwhelmed by guilt and the realization that he had harmed his own daughter.

As Bob was being transported to a holding facility, a tragic accident occurred. The vehicle crashed, resulting in Bob's death from blunt force trauma. His connection to Katie's drawings and the circumstances of his demise were eerily similar to the prophecies he had witnessed through her art.

Detective Hawthorne, reflecting on the series of events, couldn't help but sense a wicked presence influencing the lives of Bob and Katie. The drawings seemed to be more than just creations of an imaginative child—they possessed an otherworldly power that drove Bob to his tragic end.

The case of Katie Oster remains a haunting mystery—proof that sometimes, there is a darkness lurking beneath the surface of even the most innocent creations.

# Monologue
[Engaging and eerie tone]

Once upon a time, in the city of Toronto, there lived a troubled man named Bob Oster. A man whose life would soon become entangled in a web of chilling prophecies and unimaginable darkness. These prophecies were not written in ancient texts or whispered by fortune tellers, but they were drawn by his own daughter, Katie.

Detective River Hawthorne of the Toronto Police Service was tasked with uncovering the truth behind Katie's drawings and her unsettling disappearance. As he sat down with Bob for an interview, he began to unravel a tale that would send shivers down his spine.

Bob recounted the first prophetic drawing made by Katie - a coyote, devouring a dead cat. Innocent at first glance, until their neighbor's cat was mauled by a coyote shortly after. Then came the second drawing, a haunting image of two children drowning in a river. Sadly, the prophecy came true, as the Pezzola brothers met a tragic fate in the grip of an undertow. These inexplicable coincidences left Bob questioning the nature of his daughter's drawings.

In her defense, Katie claimed to have no memory of creating these prophecies. She attributed them to a mysterious "head voice" that whispered the information to her, guiding her hand across the paper. Bob, terrified by his daughter's uncanny predictions, confided in his father, desperately seeking answers. But his father dismissed it all as nonsense, refusing to believe the unbelievable.

After a year of respite, Katie's drawings returned with a vengeance. Determined to alter the course of these visions, Bob took desperate measures. He witnessed Katie drawing his deceased father, his face purple and eyes bulging. Little did Bob know, his worst fears were about to become a devastating reality. His father choked to death on a piece of steak, just as depicted in the drawing.

Overwhelmed with fear and guilt, Bob distanced himself from Katie, unable to face the horrifying truth she seemed to possess. But curiosity gnawed at him, taunting him with the need to know. And so, he ventured to check on Katie one fateful day, only to discover a drawing that would tear at the fabric of his sanity. It was an image of his own death, crushed inside a car.

Frantic and terrified, Bob demanded his daughter to change the drawing, but Katie refused, adamant that it was unalterable. In a moment of frenzy, he struck Katie, unintentionally causing her harm. Consumed by guilt and desperation, he destroyed the drawing, and took the desperate measure of reporting Katie missing to the police.

Days later, a miracle occurred. Katie was found alive, bringing a glimmer of hope to Detective Hawthorne. But for Bob, it was too late. Consumed by guilt and haunted by the realization that he had harmed his own daughter, he was being transported to a holding facility when tragedy struck once again. The vehicle crashed, and Bob met his end in a torrent of blunt force trauma.

As Detective Hawthorne pondered the series of events, a dark presence seemed to loom over Bob and Katie's lives. These drawings held a malevolent power, one that guided Bob towards his tragic demise. It was as if a wicked force had influenced their every move, their every decision.

The case of Katie Oster remains an eerie, unsolved mystery - a haunting reminder that darkness can lurk beneath even the most innocent creations. As you close your eyes tonight, beware of the drawings on the walls, the paintings in your dreams, for you never know what dreadful fate they may hold.
