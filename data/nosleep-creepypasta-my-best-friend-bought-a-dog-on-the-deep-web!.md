Title: The Dark Pact

It was a chilling evening a few weeks ago when my friend Jason and I found ourselves delving into the depths of the internet's darkest corners. We had a morbid fascination for the forbidden, often venturing into the lawless realm of the dark web to satisfy our curious appetites.

Ever since high school, when Jason discovered the tor, we had explored everything the dark web had to offer. From drug sites to snuff sites, we had seen it all. But on this particular evening, a peculiar link caught our attention. Its title, "Dolittle's Bazaar," stirred our curiosity, compelling us to click and indulge in the perverse.

A digital menagerie of exotic animals unfolded before us, showcasing species on the brink of extinction. Operated by a group of ruthless poachers, "Dolittle's Bazaar" boasted an array of rare and endangered creatures. Mesmerized by the grotesque spectacle, we scrolled through the listings, drawn to the oddities on display.

Amidst the virtual ensemble of peculiarities, a seemingly innocent pop-up appeared, advertising a dog unlike any other. Claiming unbelievable intelligence and unwavering loyalty, it piqued Jason's interest. Despite my warnings, he couldn't resist the allure of owning a one-of-a-kind canine companion, as well as the possibility of rescuing the creature from the clutches of the poachers.

Driven by his passion for animals, Jason disregarded the risk and placed the order, hoping to save the unfortunate creature from a life of misery. Little did he know the true horror that awaited him.

Weeks passed, and there was no sign of the dog. We both assumed it had been a scam, and Jason's money was lost forever. "I told you so," I would taunt him whenever we crossed paths.

But one day, an enigmatic package arrived at Jason's doorstep. Its immense size exceeded anything he had ever ordered before. Strapped to the top was a note, ominously stating, "Your unique companion has arrived. We hope you enjoy the company." Fearful but filled with a glimmer of hope, Jason called me immediately, his excitement palpable.

As I rushed to Jason's house after work, an eerie sensation washed over me. Something wasn't right. He opened the door with a hint of hesitation, his voice trembling as he spoke. "It's in the basement," he said, barely above a whisper.

Curiosity mingled with dread as I followed him down the dark staircase. There, in the dimly lit basement, a putrid odor permeated the air, assaulting our senses. Strange, animalistic noises echoed from within, sending chills down our spines.

Summoning courage, Jason called for the creature, its movements drawing closer to the dim light. At that moment, a merciless wave of terror crashed over me. The thing that emerged from the shadowed depths could not possibly be a dog. Its hairless body bore grotesque wounds, stitched together with a grim precision, as if an unholy concoction of human and canine parts had been fused together.

Overwhelmed by revulsion, I struggled to find words. Jason, too, seemed taken aback, the disappointment etched upon his face. "It's been horribly mistreated," he lamented. "The poor thing."

Unable to comprehend the abomination before us, I suggested finding a rescue center or releasing it into the wild. But Jason's determination surprised me. He refused to let Lucy go, knowing she would be unwanted and unable to survive on her own.

In the days that followed, we witnessed Jason's decline. His once vibrant spirit faded, replaced by a haunted, hollow shell. He secluded himself, plagued by an inner torment known only to him. Concerned for his well-being, I made it my mission to check on him.

Entering his house, I called out for Jason, met only with silence. A disconcerting emptiness filled the air, accentuated by the neglect evident in every corner. As I explored further, a thick booklet caught my attention, lying atop a cabinet. Its pages spoke of a creature similar to Lucy— a Sanguisuga Canis, a bloodhound subspecies subsisting solely on blood.

My horror deepened as I realized the extent of Jason's sacrifice. Weak and depleted, he had been feeding Lucy with his own blood, ensuring her survival but at the cost of his own life. Courageously, he had hidden his suffering, foregoing his once vibrant existence to protect the wretched creature.

Desperation consumed my thoughts as I grappled with the weight of this nightmarish revelation. For the sake of Jason's sacrifice, I couldn't let Lucy die. But the fear of confronting the monster that had taken my best friend's life paralyzed me.

Examining a note Jason had left behind, I discovered his plea for forgiveness and an understanding of his actions. Filled with agony and tears, I deliberated on the decision before me. Jason's final act of sacrifice had tied us together, forming a haunting bond I couldn't escape.

Hours passed as I sat in Jason's house, contemplating the fate of Lucy—a creature that symbolized death and destruction, yet held the remnants of my best friend's soul. Finally, my exhausted mind settled on a choice: I would continue feeding Lucy, honoring Jason's legacy while harboring the grief that threatened to consume me.

The silence from the basement offered temporary respite but served as a constant reminder of the darkness lurking within. With a heavy heart, I made the decision to give a part of myself to keep Lucy alive, ensuring her existence while grappling with the haunting memories of my best friend's untimely demise.

And so, the eerie presence of the Sanguisuga Canis lingered in Jason's house—a harsh reminder of the sinister pact forged in the depths of the dark web.
