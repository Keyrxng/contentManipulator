Title: The Lost Hiker: Gary William Fisk's Haunting

Script: Hello. My name is Friendly Alien, and I have a bone-chilling tale to share with you today. It revolves around the mysterious disappearance of 74-year-old Gary Fisk during his hike through Crow Pass. This case was covered by a Field Analyst and friend of the North Star Project. Prepare to be captivated by the eerie narrative. Let's delve into the details of what our unnamed Field Analyst uncovered during his investigation.

# The Haunting Disappearance: The Gary William Fisk Case

*-FA, code-named "Maketa". N.S.P.* *^((North Star Project))*

**Background:**

On September 21st, 2021, Gary Fisk embarked on the Crows' Pass hike from Girdwood to Eagle River. However, after encountering adverse weather conditions, including heavy snow and high winds, Fisk vanished without a trace. Search and rescue teams, along with aircraft crews, scoured the area but found no sign of him or his remains. The treacherous nature of the mountains surrounding the Mat-Su Valley, known for avalanches and blizzards, further complicated the search.

**Running theory:** 

Despite rescue efforts, AKST and the search teams were unable to locate any traces of Gary Fisk. The prevailing belief is that the heavy snowfall played a crucial role in his disappearance. It is speculated that the extreme weather conditions may have caused Fisk to become disoriented or seek shelter in one of the many abandoned mines in the area. However, due to the dangers associated with dilapidated mines, such as poisonous gas, cave-ins, and explosives, rescue teams often refrain from entering them. Our hypothesis, formed in collaboration with a local guide, suggests that Fisk ventured out from Girdwood and journeyed an unknown distance before being unable to proceed further or retrace his steps due to worsening weather conditions. He might have sought refuge in the lowest point of the terrain near his location. Over time, an avalanche might have buried the trail, or if he had taken shelter in a mine entrance, a bracing failure could have caused a cave-in. Regrettably, it is estimated that Fisk is likely deceased, succumbing to exposure and/or starvation.

**Planned Field Investigation:**

By August 2022, Bridger Maketa, assisted by Nathaniel Caole, will undertake a comprehensive investigation. They aim to determine Fisk's time of departure, prevailing weather conditions, and geological activities through interviews with AKST, NOAA, and Fisk's family members. This data will be cross-referenced to estimate the distance Fisk traveled. The investigation will involve searching all underground cavities in the area for any signs of Fisk, as well as evidence of recent collapses or snow coverage within the past two years. Should they locate and identify Fisk, radiation and gas levels will be measured, and any signs of injury or specific location will be carefully documented. The findings will then be forwarded to Fisk's family and AKST.

**Investigation outcome:** 

**August 18th, 2022:** Our party departed Girdwood at 12 pm, embarking on the lower and upper trails. We came across multiple locations where slides had swept debris into dense, impenetrable foliage. We managed to access one of the two available mine entrances due to time constraints. Notably, there were treacherous areas where a fall would make recovery unlikely or even implausible, especially a large canyon on the southern incline towards the summit. Prior to reaching the summit, we encountered record-breaking rainfall coupled with 60mph+ winds as we crossed Beaver Glacier. As night fell, the trail conditions deteriorated, and we decided to set up camp in a sheltered area behind a bluff.

**August 19th, 2022:** The journey resumed, but progress on the lower valley proved difficult, and we momentarily lost the trail. While backtracking to find the trail, we stumbled upon an aluminum rod deeply embedded in the brush. No other items were discovered. Undeterred, we successfully completed the first river crossing, which involved ankle-deep water. Our search continued in low areas that a lost person would likely be drawn towards. At one point, we encountered a damaged footbridge over a canyon, rendering a fall potentially fatal. Additionally, a slippery ledge over the canyon posed another hazard. As we entered the bushwhacking section of the trail, we found ourselves hindered by a female moose with a calf. The animals refused to yield, causing delays while traversing tall grass and dense foliage. After a total of 14 miles, with an additional 4 miles in detours, we reached the bank of Eagle River. It was immediately evident that water levels were much higher than usual. The lower sections of the trail leading to the fjord sight were submerged in ice-cold glacial water, forcing us to navigate along the higher sections of the floodplain. Upon reaching the fjord sight, we discovered that Eagle River was impassable. We were faced with two options: a treacherous 15-mile climb up steep, muddy slopes, or an attempt to travel south and cross the headwaters of the lake. Opting for the shorter path, we found the trail vanishing, replaced by rugged terrain and thick vegetation. We pressed on for two more miles until we were halfway around the lake. It was then that we stumbled upon a piece of grey pants on the ground, signaling that someone had been there before us. Just 50 feet away, the terrain became utterly impassable. In a nearby indent, our search took a solemn turn when we came across a bright yellow backpack. Curiously, a floral water bottle was attached to the outside, while a lighter lay abandoned on the ground, a mere three feet away. Careful not to disturb any potential evidence, we left the bag and other items untouched. Notably, the backpack contained a foam pad but no sleeping bag. Upon further examination, we discovered teeth marks on a bear canister (a food storage container) found inside the yellow bag. However, the bag itself remained unopened, indicating that its contents had not been accessed. In our continuing search, we discovered a toppled tree with a partially bitten bear spray canister, located 20 feet from the pant leg.

Before departing the site, we spotted torn red fabric approximately 50 feet above us on the western canyon side.

**Departure:**

As we embarked on our return journey, the weather swiftly deteriorated, subjecting us to countless slips and falls. The valley began flooding, turning the trail sections into flowing streams and treacherous mud pits. Determined to reach the summit cabin before nightfall, we pushed ahead, taking minimal breaks to ward off hypothermia. After covering 10 miles uphill, we reached the first river crossing. After a brief discussion, we realized that our only choice was to forge ahead, as the record-breaking flood would persist for weeks. The river had risen to waist height, with powerful currents sweeping boulders downstream. Utilizing a fjord sight, we managed to cross the river, but during the crossing, I succumbed to the freezing water. Severe hypothermia quickly took hold, rendering my legs immobile and leaving me incapacitated.

**August 20th, 2022:** In a dire emergency, we set up camp, using a bivy bag and our soaked gear. With my legs rendered useless, Nathaniel Caole embarked on a treacherous 2-mile journey to the cabin to call for help. For the next agonizing 12 hours, I lay motionless inside the bivy bag, battling the effects of severe hypothermia. Thankfully, the ANG Hilo arrived, airlifting me to Providence Anchorage for immediate medical attention.

**August 21st, 2022:** AKST and search and rescue teams ventured to the site, but their efforts yielded no remains or any trace of the clothing we discovered. They only managed to recover the backpack and bear spray.

**Deduction:** 

Our investigation uncovered shocking details about Gary Fisk's campsite, located miles ahead of the area where search and rescue teams initially suspected. Based on the evidence we found, it is presumed that Fisk departed on September 21st, 2021. As the weather worsened, he made his way downhill, trying to avoid deep snow. Upon reaching the river crossing, a day behind schedule and soaked from slush and snow, Fisk quickened his pace but lost track of the trail leading to the fjord sight. Forced to press on through increasingly challenging terrain, he eventually reached a dead end beside the lake. By this point, Fisk was suffering from severe hypothermia and had no choice but to set up a camp and attempt to start a fire. Unfortunately, as evidenced by the abandoned lighter and failed fire, he was unsuccessful, possibly due to loss of dexterity or the persistent dampness of the surroundings. What befell him after this point remains unknown. One theory suggests that, upon hearing the snowmachines used by the search and rescue crews on the eastern side of the lake, Fisk may have climbed up a cliff to signal for help, only to succumb to exposure. Another possibility is that Fisk, driven by desperation and delirium caused by hypothermia, attempted to swim across the lake, instantly succumbing to cardiac arrest due to the frigid 38-degree water.

A second theory, more chilling and sinister, suggests that Fisk was stalked by a bear and subsequently attacked and buried. This theory finds support in the presence of a significant black and brown bear population in the area, the discovery of the bear spray canister located 50 feet from the campsite bearing puncture marks from large teeth, and the torn clothes. However, the lack of any cadaver remnants from a bear attack makes this explanation less probable, as a bear mauling would typically leave behind visible evidence.
